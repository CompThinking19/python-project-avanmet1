This meets the major requirement of the milestone in that it runs, so great work there: I got a short poem in my terminal when I ran it, which is, to my understanding, exactly what we're looking for here. The current issue with the project has to do with the other requirements of the overall Python project: its scope. Right now, I'm not seeing the big picture this project is trying to address. I am impressed with the way you're reading the file in and splitting the lines up, and the kind of complexity this might eventually engender. However, I don't yet see the why of this project. This question would be answered by the presence of comments of which there are currently none.
